[![Multiple Platform IRLC Build](https://github.com/hughe349/Senior_Design_IRLTSPICE/actions/workflows/build-multi-platform.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/hughe349/Senior_Design_IRLTSPICE/actions/workflows/build-multi-platform.yml)

The IRLTSPICE Compiler (irlc), synthesizes a user's netlist into a list of programming commands sent to their Transfigurable and Super Programmable Integrated Circuit Element (TSPICE).
It's possible we got carried away with the acronymns.
